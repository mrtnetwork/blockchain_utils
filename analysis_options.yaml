# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

# Uncomment the following section to specify additional rules.
linter:
  rules:
    prefer_final_locals: true        # Warns when a local variable could be final
    prefer_final_in_for_each: true   # Warns when a forEach variable could be final
    prefer_const_constructors: true  # Warns when a constructor could be const
    prefer_const_declarations: true  # Warns when a declaration could be const

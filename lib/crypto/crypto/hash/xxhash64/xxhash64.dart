//   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
//   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
//   source, and configuration files.

//   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
//   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
//   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
//   and conversions to other media types.

//   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
//   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
//   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
//   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

//   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
//   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
//   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
//   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
//   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
//   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
//   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

//   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
//   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

//   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
//   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
//   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
//   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

// 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
//   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
//   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
//   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
//   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
//   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

// 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
//   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
//   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
//   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
//   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
//   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
//   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
//   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
//   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
//   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
//   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
//   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
//   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
//   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
//   as of the date such litigation is filed.

// 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
//   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
//   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
//   meet the following conditions:

//   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
//       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

//   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
//       stating that You changed the files; and

//   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
//       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
//       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
//       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
//       the Derivative Works; and

//   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
//       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
//       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
//       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
//       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
//       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
//       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
//       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
//       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
//       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
//       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
//       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
//       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
//       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
//       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
//       as modifying the License.

//   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
//   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
//   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
//   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
//   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
//   the conditions stated in this License.

// 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
//   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
//   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
//   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
//   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
//   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
//   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

// 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
//   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
//   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
//   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

// 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
//   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
//   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
//   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
//   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
//   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
//   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
//   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
//   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

// 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
//   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
//   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
//   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
//   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
//   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
//   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
//   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
//   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
//   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
//   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

// 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
//   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
//   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
//   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
//   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
//   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
//   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
//   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
//   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
//   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/// Represents an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher.
///
/// The AES class implements the BlockCipher interface and provides methods for encryption
/// and decryption of data using the AES algorithm. It supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
///
/// Key Schedule:
/// - The key schedule is computed during key initialization using the `_lib` AES library.
///
/// Block Size:
/// - AES operates on 128-bit blocks of data.
///
/// Key Initialization:
/// - To initialize the cipher with a key, use the `setKey` method.
///
/// Encryption and Decryption:
/// - Use the `encryptBlock` method to encrypt a 128-bit block of data.
/// - Use the `decryptBlock` method to decrypt a 128-bit block of data (if the instance allows decryption).
///
/// Memory Cleanup:
/// - The `clean` method can be used to securely zero and release the internal key schedule data.
///
/// Note: This class should be used with caution, as it operates directly on byte arrays and requires proper
/// key management and memory cleanup to ensure security.
